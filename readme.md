The dataset shared in this project is the Tripitaka Koreana in Han (TKH) Dataset and the Multiple Tripitaka in Han (MTH) Dataset.
To facilitate the research in Chinese historical documents,
we extend the size of the [original dataset](https://github.com/HCIILAB/TKH_MTH_Datasets_Release) with layout, characters, and text lines annotation.
More challenging document images from the Internet are added to MTH dataset whose images number is now 2200, therefore named TKH-MTH2200.

In this dataset, we provide three types of annotations(Samples are shown in Visualization).
- The first type is line-level annotation, including text line location and its transcription, which is saved in reading order.
- The second type is character-level annotation, which includes class categories and bounding box coordinates.
- The last type is the boundary lines, represented by the start and end points of line segments.

We randomly split the TKH-MTH2200 dataset into training set and test set with the ratio of 3:1.
Details of the training set and test set can also be viewed in this project.
